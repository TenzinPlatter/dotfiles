# Dotfiles

Personal dotfiles repository with automated git workflow using the [Watcher](https://github.com/TenzinPlatter/watcher) package.

## Setup
    1. Clone this repo and put your machine on its own branch to avoid merge conflicts (watcher will notify you if there were changes on other branches, you can merge them manually if you like)
    2. Install watcher
    3. Setup watcher to watch the dotfiles directory
    4. Done!
